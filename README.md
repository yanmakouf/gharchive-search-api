## Versionning Rules (temporary)
During the migration of all the mails to the new architecture we use a slightly different rule for versionning the project. It goes as follow :
- For each mail migration to the new architecture we will increment the minor version (1.0.\*). 
- For each mail deletion from the legacy architecture we will increment the patch version (1.\*.0)
- Finally when migration will be finished we will increment the major version to 3.0.0
